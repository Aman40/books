Parcel:
	A data structure designed for sharing data between processes.
There are up to 6 different classes for reading and writing primitive data types
to parcels.
	There's also a plethora of methods for writing arrays of primitives to parcels.

USING LOCATION
The purpose of this is to show the closest items to the user first
1. 	The user's location is not necessary. It will be obtained or requested 
	(for browsers) real time to display the closest items. 
	
	If a student, the user's school's zip code is taken. This willl be used 
	as a fallback for items' location when not provided.

BOOKS LOCATION
1. 	For each book added, a default location, based on the user's, will be auto-filled.
	Users can then change this, should it differ from the real one.
	Using this, the latitude and longitude of each will be triangulated. From these, and
	the user's location, materials can be shown from closest first.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Edit the sequel.sql 
2. Edit the Client book addition form and signup from.
3. Add the columns to the db table. Try not to erase the already existing data.
4. Test by adding another book.
5. Sign up for a google id
6. Display a map in the app and show the locations of the books.
7. Create the user signup form and book addition form.
8. GOOD LUCK!!
