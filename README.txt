Name: Books (Temporary name)
Problem:
Every new semester, students have to spend more than 20,000 yen on
text books, all while old students have nothing to do with theirs once
they're done with the subjects or courses. The sharing and reusing
culture here in Japan is quite lacking with people throwing away perfectly "healthy"
items other than giving them to those who need them! And it's all fine
because a lot of people can afford that and there is no convenient way
to pass down property in a society where interaction between strangers
is minimal.

Solution Description:
A web application for sharing, distributing and trading books and
text books primarily among University Students, primarily in Japan.
